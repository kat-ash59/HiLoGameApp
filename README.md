google to look up how to generate a random number in java between 1 and 20

copied the code with minor changes used 20 rather than 100 and called the variable name computerGuess

while loops

for loops

### Lessons Learned

finding break points is sort of hard, best thing is to trace code line by line

make lots of comments in code to kick in the head to understand how things work

very helpful to have prints for debug statements

had to figure out where to put read so didn't read to many times

also ran multiple times to ensure asthetically pleasing by adding new lines and fun comments

don't forget to get new random number to play next game

LOL grates against my nerves and inner QA to no have error handling LOL
